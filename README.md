# Baking: A Childhood's Treasure üßÅ

This is a simple, single-page landing site about the joy of baking, created as my first project for the SheCodes bootcamp. The page is a personal tribute to baking memories and includes an interactive element to reveal a favorite recipe.

### Key Features

* **Static Page:** A single-page website built with HTML and CSS.
* **Dynamic Welcome:** Uses JavaScript `prompt()` to get the user's name and favorite baked good, then displays a personalized welcome message via an `alert()`.
* **Interactive Recipe Unlock:** A button that, when clicked, runs a JavaScript function to make a hidden "secret" recipe link appear on the page.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Used for the core structure and content.
* **Internal CSS:** All styling is contained in a `<style>` tag in the HTML head, using classes, IDs, and element selectors.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used for all interactive elements, including `document.querySelector`, `addEventListener`, and DOM manipulation (`.style.display`).

### What I Learned

This project was my first experience in building a complete webpage from scratch. The key skills I learned were:

* Writing semantic HTML to structure a page.
* Using internal CSS to style all elements, including backgrounds, fonts, and button hover-effects.
* How to "listen" for a user action (like a click) with an `addEventListener`.
* How to get user input with `prompt()` and display feedback with `alert()`.
* The basics of DOM manipulation: specifically, how to change the CSS of an element using JavaScript (`.style.display = "block"`) to show a hidden item.
